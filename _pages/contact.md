## Prospective Students

If you contact me with regards to open positions, please include your CV and transcript in the email. Be specific regarding why you contact *me*. For example, to what extent are your research interests related to the research topics of my research group?

**I will ignore all impersonal emails, e.g., emails that do not include my name or are a clear copy-paste of emails sent to other professors (including emails sent to other CISPA professors).**

PS: adding a PS with the full name of the conference where my last paper was published would definitely bring bonus points.


## Datasets

Most of our research prototypes are already available on GitHub, e.g., [DoubleX](https://github.com/Aurore54F/DoubleX), [HideNoSeek](https://github.com/Aurore54F/HideNoSeek), [JStap](https://github.com/Aurore54F/JStap), [JaSt](https://github.com/Aurore54F/JaSt), etc. Other research prototypes can be found [here](https://github.com/Aurore54F?tab=repositories).

Some of the datasets we used in our experiments are directly referenced in the corresponding papers.
For example,
- [geeksonsecurity/js-malicious-dataset](https://github.com/geeksonsecurity/js-malicious-dataset)
- [HynekPetrak/javascript-malware-collection](https://github.com/HynekPetrak/javascript-malware-collection)

If you need access to other datasets for research purposes, feel free to send me a specific email with the following items:
- please, use your academic email address;
- put the PI in CC;
- add a brief description of what you need the datasets for; if you have published papers in the field, feel free to mention that.

**I will ignore emails that do not contain these information.**


## Misc

If you contact me for other professional reasons, I expect emails to be specific and to the point. **If I do not know why I am being contacted or what is expected of me, I will ignore the email.**
