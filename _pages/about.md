I am a third year Ph.D. student in the [Secure Web Applications Group](https://swag.cispa.saarland) at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.saarland), jointly supervised by [Ben Stock](https://swag.cispa.saarland/people/benstock.html) and [Michael Backes](https://www.infsec.cs.uni-saarland.de/people/~backes/).

My research interests include static malware analysis and detection (with special focus on JavaScript code), machine learning, adversarial attacks.

Prior to that, I was a master student at the French Grande École [TELECOM Nancy](https://telecomnancy.univ-lorraine.fr/en), where I had the honour to give the valedictorian speech (2017). In particular, I wrote my master's thesis at the German Federal Office for Information Security ([BSI](https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/)) under the supervision of [Isabelle Chrisment](https://members.loria.fr/IChrisment/) and Robert Krawczyk.
