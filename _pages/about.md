I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [Stanford University](https://cs.stanford.edu).
My research broadly focuses on Web security and privacy, Web measurements, and machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in detecting malware & vulnerabilities on the Web and collecting data to better understand and improve user security and privacy.

In 2021, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.saarland).
Prior to that, I was a PhD student at CISPA (2017-2020), in the [Secure Web Applications Group](https://swag.cispa.saarland), jointly supervised by [Ben Stock](https://swag.cispa.saarland/people/benstock.html) and [Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/en/people/backes). My PhD thesis revolves around studying JavaScript security through static analysis.

Before joining CISPA, I was a master student at the French Grande Ecole [TELECOM Nancy](https://telecomnancy.univ-lorraine.fr/en), where I had the honor to give the valedictorian speech (2017). In particular, I wrote my master thesis at the German Federal Office for Information Security ([BSI](https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/)) under the supervision of [Isabelle Chrisment](https://members.loria.fr/IChrisment/) and Robert Krawczyk.
