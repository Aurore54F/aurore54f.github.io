I am a postdoctoral researcher at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.saarland).
Prior to that, I was a PhD student in the [Secure Web Applications Group](https://swag.cispa.saarland) at CISPA, jointly supervised by [Ben Stock](https://swag.cispa.saarland/people/benstock.html) and [Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/en/people/backes).

Before joining CISPA, I was a master student at the French Grande Ecole [TELECOM Nancy](https://telecomnancy.univ-lorraine.fr/en), where I had the honor to give the valedictorian speech (2017). In particular, I wrote my master thesis at the German Federal Office for Information Security ([BSI](https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/)) under the supervision of [Isabelle Chrisment](https://members.loria.fr/IChrisment/) and Robert Krawczyk.


My PhD thesis revolves around studying JavaScript security through static analysis. In particular, my research interests include static code analysis, malware & vulnerability detection, machine learning, and adversarial attacks. I presented my research work at several academic and non-academic venues like CCS, ACSAC, DSN, DIMVA, RuhrSec, MADWeb, and Blackhoodie.  
I am also a regular external reviewer at top academic venues such as USENIX Security, NDSS, CCS, Euro S&P, and ACSAC.  
Finally, I am happy to supervise bachelor and master students in the scope of research projects and of our yearly web security seminar.
