I am a Tenure-Track Faculty at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de)
My research broadly focuses on Web security and privacy, Web measurements, and machine learning. Specifically, I design practical approaches to protect the security and privacy of Web users. I build systems to proactively detect malicious JavaScript code and suspicious browser extensions. I analyze data to understand how people spend time on the Web, and I want to use the resulting perspective to prioritize defense strategies.

Before that, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [Stanford University](https://cs.stanford.edu) (2021--2023), in the [Empirical Security Research Group](https://esrg.stanford.edu), led by [Zakir Durumeric](https://zakird.com).
Prior to that, I was a PhD student at CISPA (2018-2021), in the [Secure Web Applications Group](https://swag.cispa.saarland), jointly supervised by [Ben Stock](https://swag.cispa.saarland/people/benstock.html) and [Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/en/people/backes). My [PhD thesis](https://publications.cispa.saarland/3471/7/fass2020thesis.pdf) revolves around studying JavaScript security through static analysis.

Before joining CISPA, I was a master student at the French Grande Ecole [TELECOM Nancy](https://telecomnancy.univ-lorraine.fr/en), where I had the honor to give the valedictorian speech (2017). In particular, I wrote my master thesis at the German Federal Office for Information Security ([BSI](https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/)) under the supervision of [Isabelle Chrisment](https://members.loria.fr/IChrisment/) and Robert Krawczyk.
