My group's research revolves around designing practical approaches to protect the security and privacy of Web users. We build systems to proactively detect malicious JavaScript code and suspicious browser extensions. We analyze data to understand how people spend time on the Web and how to prioritize defense strategies.


**1) Uncovering and preventing JavaScript-based attacks**

Our prior work focused on detecting malicious JavaScript code by means of static analysis combined with machine learning algorithms.
 ([JaSt-DIMVA18](https://swag.cispa.saarland/papers/fass2018jast.pdf), [JStap-ACSAC19](https://swag.cispa.saarland/papers/fass2019jstap.pdf)). In fact, benign and malicious JavaScript samples tend to have different syntactic patters ([DSN21](https://swag.cispa.saarland/papers/moog2021statically.pdf)). However, we showed that most static detectors are not robust in presence of an adversary who can camouflage their malicious code with a benign syntax to evade detection ([HideNoSeek-CCS19](https://swag.cispa.saarland/papers/fass2019hidenoseek.pdf)).


**2) Securing the browser extension ecosystem**

By design, browser extensions have access to security- and privacy-critical APIs to perform tasks that web pages cannot traditionally do.
Our prior work focused on detecting vulnerable extensions. We developed a static analyzer to track and detect suspicious data flows between an attacker and sensitive APIs in extensions ([DoubleX-CCS21](https://swag.cispa.saarland/papers/fass2021doublex.pdf)).
Besides vulnerable extensions, our ongoing projects include detecting fingerprintable extensions and adopting a more data-driven approach to fundamentally understand how browser extensions are designed, used, and could be exploited.


**3) Understanding how to prioritize defense strategies through Web measurements**

To effectively protect user security and privacy online, we first need to understand how people use the Web, as well as the types of websites they frequent and spend the most time on ([IMC21](https://publications.cispa.saarland/3786/1/ruth2022browsing.pdf)).


## PhD Positions

I am looking for PhD candidates with research interests in Web Security & Privacy and Web Measurements, in line with the 3 directions discussed above.
However, I also welcome new research directions, and it is a plus when a student brings their own ideas.


Note that the open positions are not project-bound and that you are free to choose your research projects.



I am looking for motivated students with solid programming skills in python and (at least) a basic background in Web security. Proficiency in spoken and written English is a must; German knowledge is not necessary. I expect students to be curious, creative, and have a strong willingness to learn & improve.

In return, we offer an excellent research environment in Sankt Ingbert, with close individual supervision, worldwide collaborations, competitive salary according to [TVÃ¶D-13](https://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tvoed/bund/a/2022?id=tvoed-bund-2022&g=E_13&s=1&zv=VBL&z=100&zulage=&stkl=1&r=0&zkf=0&kk=15.5%25), and with significant funding for travel and equipment.


If you are interested, please apply through [CISPA's centralized application portal](https://jobs.cispa.saarland/jobs/detail/phd-students-1). Make sure that your cover letter mentions my research group and why you would be a good fit. If you have any questions, first read [this page](https://aurore54f.github.io/contact/) on how to contact me and then send me an email accordingly.



## Bachelor / Master Theses

I offer theses in the areas discussed above, but I also welcome new research directions if you already have a specific idea for your thesis.
I highly recommend you have good programming skills in python and (at least) a basic background in Web security. Having attended a seminar is a plus. Proficiency in spoken and written English is a must; German knowledge is not necessary. I expect students to be curious, creative, and have a strong willingness to learn. Note that theses in this group are typically high-effort / high-reward, meaning that good theses are meant to be submitted as papers to major security conferences. Consider that you should be able to spend *at least* 20h / week working on your thesis topic for the duration of your thesis.

If you are interested in doing your thesis with me, first read [this page](https://aurore54f.github.io/contact/) on how to contact me and then send me an email accordingly.
